## Overview:
A suite of general Python scripts.

## Contents:
- `2x2 Matrix Inversion` (_Jupyter Notebook_ & _.py_ file)

## Note:
Dear reader,

This is perhaps my most basic repository. It contains a variety of files I wrote when first learning to code. Where possible I have tried to make them neater, and in certain cases provide additional information, but for the majority I have left the bulk of the code as it was. 

I decided to include this repository for a two of reasons. Firstly, whilst they may be short and simple, some of the scripts do require subtle tricks which I am sure to forget at some point in the future. Secondly, I hope that anyone that happens to stumble across them may find them in some way useful, even if it's simply a lesson in what not to do.

H ✌️
